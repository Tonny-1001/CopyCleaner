# CopyCleaner
Simple duplicate file cleaner.

### How it works?
Program scans all files in the specified directory and creates a hash from each file and then checks whether any of the generated hashes have repeated, if so, it means that the file is duplicate and it needs to be deleted.

### TODO:
- [ ] Rewrite program using rich library just for better look
- [ ] Make app look good (curses library)
